                    <em>"The mind is an essence independent of the matter with its nature but has to do with its actions"</em> - It is the beautiful definition of mind. The human mind is a complex thing. Even these days, people still couldn’t find
                    out the mystery of the mind. Scientifically, there are a lot of explanations out there to support the theory of thinking, means how can we think actually think about anything, how can we guess. There are still no concrete theories of
                    how our thought emerges. It becomes complicated especially when multiple variables are involved. Have you ever heard the word <strong>Mastermind</strong>? It sounds remarkably bold but obviously, it has some significant reason to
                    mention it like this. I believe our mind has some tremendous power to accelerate everything which we do in our daily life. And my hypothesis is about the immense power which we possess inside our mind.

                  <p>
                    Life is like one big guessing gameplay. We guess a lot on a daily basis that we even don’t realize. Sometimes our guesses perfectly hit the dot and sometimes it goes horribly wrong. No matter what our prediction flow goes, we
                    always try to predict future outcomes of an event that we care. Whether it comes from a specific intention or unintentional matter, we imagine the result in our own way. That’s okay and should be it. But here is the fact that how
                    we sense the outcomes with our bare minds? What intelligence that our mind has the ability to take control of the futuristic events? Okay now, let me tell you the definition of “Future”. According to Wikipedia “The Future is the
                    time after the present. Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of time” Simply what we are going to do, what will happen in the hereafter is called “The Future”. The things we imagine, the moments we intend to
                    do or do not will have happened eventually is defined as the future.
                  </p>

                  <br>

                  <p>
                    Let’s jump to an example. Let’s say you get up in the morning every day and go to school or college. Every night before sleep, you may think about to go to school in the morning and that’s why you finished your homework properly.
                    So, you know what’s going to happen in the morning. So that’s a fair prediction which will be going to happen. In this
                    case, is your imagination is the future or not? Yes, undoubtedly it is. Furthermore, you can also think that you will skip school because you couldn’t finish your homework today. According to your plan, you skip the class the next
                    morning. You do exactly what you thought last night. But here is a new case arise, if you about to go to school in the morning and heavy rain is just started then what will you do? There are 3 general possibilities will be
                    happened in this case.
                  </p>

                  <br>

                  <ol type="I">
                    <li>You may go to school with an umbrella </li>
                    <li>You may go to school without an umbrella by enjoying the rain (some might say by suffering) </li>
                    <li>Or You can declare that today is your unofficial holiday.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <br>

                  <p>
                    I assume you are conscious about the possible outcomes and you thought all 3 possibilities already before the rain will arrive. But are you sure only these 3 things will happen to you if the rain strikes? Absolutely not! You may
                    have to go to the hospital if someone got sick of your family in this heavy rain in the morning. Also, the entire city may be destroyed due to a sudden earthquake in the rain. No one knows what exactly happens but Allah. Now you
                    can ask, many things can happen which you didn’t think about. You can start arguing with me that, I thought I would go to school, but a very different thing happened to me that I never thought about. So how do I imagine my
                    future? Well, my friend, Future is an infinite succession of the present. It has infinite possibilities. Likewise, our thinking is also vast and infinite. We can think about anything. But that’s not what we think about it would be
                    happened. We don’t think regarding every possible thing that we are going to face or can’t think about that at all. One reason for this may be our knowledge is limited. But there are many people who have a sharp-prediction
                    capability. Is the power of our thinking so intense that we can predict the future precisely? I think our brains are so powerful that they can guess the future, more specifically, see the future. Sometimes they are accurate and sometimes they aren’t. But we have
                    our very own ability to see the future through our mind, to think and analyze it. So, is our brain a God-gifted time machine? So, is the neuron of our own is a powerful vortex? Perhaps it is. Time is the fourth dimension and it is relative
                    in the universe. That means it varies from person to person, objects to object and galaxy to galaxy. If we can learn how to control time somehow with our powerful brain, we will able to rule the universe.
