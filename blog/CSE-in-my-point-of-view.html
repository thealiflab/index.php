                    Computer Science and Engineering is an academic undergraduate program in all over the world which allow you to work in the advance area of Information and technology. At the very beginning, Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)
                    was a sub-field of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) but now, it becomes so necessary and demandable that it creates its own sector for study and research. Moreover, a CSE degree has tremendous job opportunities in
                    nearly every type of field now.
                  </p>

                  <br>

                  <p>Okay, let me tell you my story in short.</p>


                  <br>

                  <p>
                    When I was a child, I fell in love with computers. I started to learn and operate the computer from one of my neighbors. Having my own computer was a dream back then. It was too expensive and rare so that very few people can
                    afford computers on their own. I’m a huge fan of ’90s games and my first interaction with computer because of these. I still remember that my elder sister bought me the first computer and I was happy as a lark. That changed my
                    whole life and everything. I learned everything to operate the computer on my own and it became my best friend. I was fascinated and pledged with this device so much when I explored more and more. Then I thought that I want to
                    become a computer engineer in the near future and playing with it whenever I want. But I was totally wrong. Computer Science is not just about computers, there’s a lot more stuff to cover. We do a lot of things now as a CS
                    engineer. When it’s time to decide where to study, which sector should I pick as my career path, where to go in life? And Yes! I chose Computer Science. In that case, I had to ditch a public University where I got a chance and
                    enrolled myself in Private University for the sake of CSE. Neither I regret nor hesitate, I totally appreciate my decision till now because I think this is the right one. I believe everyone has some expectations for their study and
                    I have some presumption too. Some were totally on point what I thought before about CSE, some gone partially okay but most of them gone totally opposite. CS is not an easy piece of cake. Being specifically, you have to gamble with
                    two things. If you want skills, you may not maintain your CGPA and if you want to have a higher CGPA, then you may not get enough time to work on your skills. I named this #CSCrisis for fun. Well, that’s only my opinion. It may or may
                    not be true for everyone. I saw a lot of people who insanely maintain both as well. And the rest suffered in #CSCrisis. You have to be proactive and energetic enough to study on this subject.
                  </p>

                  <br>

                  <p>
                    Computer Science is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. As a Computer Science Engineer, you can constantly change the world with your skills, ideas and innovation. CS engineers are like a wizard in society, everyone
                    wants them to fix their problem. Their attitude is like get an idea, plan the work and execute the plan. Chop chop!! You can get a lot of chances to make new things every day with magic (literally means “coding”). Being a CS
                    engineer is not easy but it is definitely fun if you have enough interest in it! Obviously, interest and choice matters in the first place and no arguing with that.
                  </p>

                  <br>

                  <p>Now I want to discuss the pros and cons of Computer Science and Engineering based on our current situation.</p>

                      it seems like a dream but it can happen if you are skilled enough. A skilled engineer can get all kind of facility that he/she dreamed about his/her life.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <li>Freelance earning opportunities</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>

                  <h3>Cons</h3>

                  <ol type="1">
                    <li><em>"Expectations Kills"</em> -  I believe you are passionate about computer science, you love computers, you also do love math and physics and now you are enrolled in CSE. All goes according to your plan but suddenly you feel something wrong with yourself. You’re experiencing so much pressure on your head and that’s happening because you didn’t expect the vast curriculum to read in this subject. Engineering is not a piece of cake (like I mentioned earlier) that we desire to eat. It is much more like “alligator pear” that you have to swallow for the sake of good health as well as to survive on this path.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                      Sometimes you feel like you have been arrested to develop or code on a particular project which you are failed to find any interest to do it but you have to do it for the sake of some grade points. Creativity increase productivity but the unwanted job would do the opposite.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                      It is an expensive subject as you can see that some equipment is necessary for continuing your education. You cannot do a single thing peacefully without your own device (Laptop/Desktop). Here practicals are more often than theories. At least you have a good functioning Laptop to study in CS with all respect.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                      If you choose CS because of your Dad or mom tells you to choose, then you will find yourself in a fool’s paradise later on. So don’t do that. Try to prioritize your decision
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                      Right now, there are a lot of CS Engineers out there. If you want to compete with them, you have to be a skillful engineer. You have to show some extraordinary things that many may not have.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>
                      We are not living in Silicon Valley, by keeping that in our mind, there are so many low budget startups out there who want to hire you as an intern and do not pay you well that you deserve. They expect a lot more from you and burden you with unnecessary work which may not be beneficial for you in the future. Fresh graduates lose their dignity and market value to give themselves up to these companies and works relentlessly.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                  </ol>

                  <p>
                    Choosing CSE as your Bachelor degree may not be an easy choice for you (Honestly talking). Nowadays it’s a trend to study in CS but here is a thing my friend that a boat without a rudder has to pay its debt to nature in the deep ocean. Unless you have an automated boat. Peace ;)
